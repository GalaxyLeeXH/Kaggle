Businesses forecast product demand, governments forecast economic and population growth, meteorologists forecast the weather. The understanding of things to come is a pressing need across science, government, and industry (not to mention our personal lives!), and practitioners in these fields are increasingly applying machine learning to address this need.\n\nTime series forecasting is a broad field with a long history. This course focuses on the application of modern machine learning methods to time series data with the goal of producing the most accurate predictions. The lessons in this course were inspired by winning solutions from past Kaggle forecasting competitions but will be applicable whenever accurate forecasts are a priority.\n\nAfter finishing this course, you'll know how to:\n- engineer features to model the major time series components (*trends*, *seasons*, and *cycles*),\n- visualize time series with many kinds of *time series plots*,\n- create forecasting *hybrids* that combine the strengths of complementary models, and\n- adapt machine learning methods to a variety of forecasting tasks.\n\nAs part of the exercises, you'll get a chance to participate in our [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/29781) Getting Started competition. In this competition, you're tasked with forecasting sales for *Corporación Favorita* (a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer) in almost 1800 product categories.\n\n# What is a Time Series? #\n\nThe basic object of forecasting is the **time series**, which is a set of observations recorded over time. In forecasting applications, the observations are typically recorded with a regular frequency, like daily or monthly.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" 1、本案例中使用lag1，也就是偏移一个单位，说白了就是今天的销售额取决于昨天的销售额，因此是简单的\n    线性关系，通过后续的图示可以看出时线性增长的，原因就在这，训练出一个正的权重来就是单调递增\n    \n    2、如果说变成长时间依赖或者数据之间的关系是复杂的非线性，那么线性模型就失效了，此时应该考虑其他的\n    更加复杂的机器学习方法\n\n    3、 lag1表示前后一天的数据，lag7则表示一个星期以前的数据，lag365则表示一年前的数据，处理周期\n    型数据可能就不适用了，这个时候就考虑第二节 - trend","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\n    \"../input/ts-course-data/book_sales.csv\",\n    # 指定Date为索引列，用来标识每行数据\n    index_col='Date',\n    # 将Date这一列数据转换成为date的格式\n    parse_dates=['Date'],\n).drop('Paperback', axis=1)\n\ndf.head()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-05T08:15:46.136614Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-05T08:15:46.137070Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-05T08:15:46.449973Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-05T08:15:46.137039Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-05T08:15:46.448954Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This series records the number of hardcover book sales at a retail store over 30 days. Notice that we have a single column of observations `Hardcover` with a time index `Date`.\n\n# Linear Regression with Time Series #\n\nFor the first part of this course, we'll use the linear regression algorithm to construct forecasting models. Linear regression is widely used in practice and adapts naturally to even complex forecasting tasks.\n\nThe **linear regression** algorithm learns how to make a weighted sum from its input features. For two features, we would have:\n\n```\ntarget = weight_1 * feature_1 + weight_2 * feature_2 + bias\n```\n\nDuring training, the regression algorithm learns values for the parameters `weight_1`, `weight_2`, and `bias` that best fit the `target`. (This algorithm is often called *ordinary least squares* since it chooses values that minimize the squared error between the target and the predictions.) The weights are also called *regression coefficients* and the `bias` is also called the *intercept* because it tells you where the graph of this function crosses the y-axis.\n\n### Time-step features\n\nThere are two kinds of features unique to time series: time-step features and lag features.\n\nTime-step features are features we can derive directly from the time index. The most basic time-step feature is the **time dummy**, which counts off time steps in the series from beginning to end.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport numpy as np\n# 创建一列Time，值就是顺序下来的\ndf['Time'] = np.arange(len(df.index))\n# 读入数据的时候指定的索引为Date\nprint(df.index)\ndf.head()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-05T08:20:10.041234Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-05T08:20:10.041582Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-05T08:20:10.052814Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-05T08:20:10.041549Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-05T08:20:10.051672Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Linear regression with the time dummy produces the model:\n\n```\ntarget = weight * time + bias\n```\n\nThe time dummy then lets us fit curves to time series in a *time plot*, where `Time` forms the x-axis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n# 设置图标样式为seaborn库中的白色背景和灰色网格线\nplt.style.use(\"seaborn-whitegrid\")\n# 自定义图表figure和轴axes的属性\nplt.rc(\n    \"figure\",\n    autolayout=True,\n    figsize=(11, 4),\n    titlesize=18,\n    titleweight='bold',\n)\nplt.rc(\n    \"axes\",\n    labelweight=\"bold\",\n    labelsize=\"large\",\n    titleweight=\"bold\",\n    titlesize=16,\n    titlepad=10,\n)\n# 魔法命令，提高分辨率\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'\n# 总体目标 - 绘制时间和Hardcover的折现和回归线，对应真实值和预测值\n# 图表和轴对象\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot('Time', 'Hardcover', data=df, color='0.75')\n# 绘制一个回归线\nax = sns.regplot(x='Time', y='Hardcover', data=df, ci=None, scatter_kws=dict(color='0.25'))\nax.set_title('Time Plot of Hardcover Sales');","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-05T08:22:50.147163Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-05T08:22:50.147455Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-05T08:22:51.314991Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-05T08:22:50.147434Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-05T08:22:51.313975Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Time-step features let you model **time dependence**.
